# Ack2 Roadmap

## Get ack -f working

* Get option-handling working
* Implement file-finding object
* Bring over -f tests
* Make all -f tests pass

## Implement search functionality (or bring it over from Ack1)

* Create file/resource objects

## Make sure all previous command options are supported (this clearly needs fleshing out)
